# Hello, Alexa!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Alexa!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-alexa) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Alexa. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Alexa and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to create a simple voice skill. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Alexa Project

We will create a simple Alexa skill that reports the current time in a variety of locations. We'll write a C# Lambda function to be the back-end for this skill. In future posts, we'll build more elaborate skills that sustain a dialog.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
